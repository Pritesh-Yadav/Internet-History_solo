    <h1><span>AAA</span></h1>

    <p>
        AAA stands for Arrange, Act, Assert. AAA is a way to structure unit tests so they are easier to read, maintain
        and enhance. AAA pattern is a pattern for structuring tests. It breaks each test down into three parts Arrange,
        Act and Assert. Where each part is a step leading to the next. Arrange step sets up the test's input value, the
        Act step prompts the primary function being tested, and the Assert step verifies that the output of the
        function is what we expected.

    </p>

</div>


<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Arrange Act Assert</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Arrange-Act-Assert(also AAA and 3A) pattern of testing was observed and named by Bill Wake in 2001.
        I first came across it in Kent Becks book Test Driven Development By Example.
        The pattern focuses each test on a single action. The advantage of this focus is that it clearly separates the
        arrangement of the System Under Test (SUT) and the assertions that are made on it after the action.
        On multiple projects I have experienced organised and clean code in the main codebase but disorganisation and
        inconsistency in the test suite. However when AAA is applied, I have found it helps by unifying and clarifying
        the structure of tests which helps make the test suite much more understandable and manageable.

    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Arrange</span></h1>
    <p>
        Arrange step sets up the tests input value. The block of code that sets the condition for the test action.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>EXAMPLE</span></h1>
    <p>
        Example of Arrange:

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Rules and Regulations</span></h1>
    <p>
        Use only a single block of code without empty lines. Should not use assert in the Arrange block. If you need to
        make assertion about our arrangement, then this is a smell that your arrangement is too complicated and should
        be extracted to a fixture or setup function and tested in its own right. Only prepare non-deterministic results
        not available after action. The arrange section will not require comments. If you have a large arrangement in
        your tests which is complex enough to require detailed comments then consider Extracting the comments into a
        multi-line docstring. Extracting the arrangement code into the fixture and testing that fixture is establishing
        the expected conditions as previously mentioned regulation.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Act</span></h1>
    <p>
        Line of code where the action is taken on the SUT. This Act step prompts the primary function being tested
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>EXAMPLE</span></h1>
    <p>
        Example of Act:

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Rules</span></h1>
    <p>
        This makes it easier to distinguish test actions and you can avoid the hardest job in programming i.e., naming.
        When every result is called result, then you do not need to waste brain power wondering if it should be
        item = or response = etc. An added benefit is that you can find test actions easily with a tool like grep.
        Even when there is no result from the action, capture it with result = and then assert result is None. In this
        way, the SUTs behaviour is pinned.
        If you struggle to write a single line action, then consider extracting some of that code into your arrangement.
        The action can be wrapped in with raises for expected exceptions. In your action will be two lines surrounded
        by empty lines.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Assert </span></h1>
    <p>
        The block of code which performs the assertions on the state of SUT after action. Assert step verifies that the
        output of the function is what we expected.

    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h1><span>EXAMPLE </span></h1>
    <p>
        Example of Assert:

    <h1><span>Rules</span></h1>
    <p>
        Use a single block of code with no empty lines. First test that results, then test side effects. Limit the
        actions that you make in this block. No actions should happen which is not always possible. Use simple blocks
        of assertions. If you find that you are repeatedly writing the same code to extract information from the SUT
        and perform assertions on it, then consider extracting an assertion helper.
